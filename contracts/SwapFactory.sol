/**
 * @dev SwapFactory is a helper for creating Swaps and making asset structs.
 *
 * This helper can be used on and off-chain to easily create a Swap struct to be
 * used in the {Swaplace-createSwap} function.
 *
 * Swaplace uses a {ISwap-Swap} struct to represent a Swap. This struct is
 * composed of:
 *
 * - The `owner` of the Swap is the address that created the Swap.
 * - The `allowed` address is the address that can accept the Swap. If the allowed
 *   address is the zero address, then anyone can accept the Swap.
 * - The `expiry` date is the timestamp that the Swap will be available to accept.
 * - The `biding` are the assets that the owner is offering.
 * - The `asking` are the assets that the owner wants in exchange.
 *
 * The Swap struct uses an {Asset} struct to represent the asset. This struct is
 * composed of:
 *
 * - The `address` of the asset. This address can be from an ERC20 or ERC721 contract.
 * - The `amount` or `id` of the asset. This amount can be the amount of ERC20 tokens
 *  or the id of an ERC721 token.
 *
 * To use other standards, like ERC1155, you can wrap the ownership of the asset
 * in an a trusted contract and Swap as an ERC721. This way, you can tokenize any
 * on-chain execution and trade on Swaplace.
