## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, but here are a few steps to start:

1. Fork the repository in GitHub
2. Check if you have any issue, suggestion or improvement to work in.

   - We manage all the issues using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/blockful-io/projects/3)

3. Send a message in the issue like
   `I'm interested in this issue` or ask for more information like `Hey, can you provide more information about this ... ?`and the mantainers will assigned or provide more context about your issue. **After that, you are asigned to the issue.**

4. If a task is already assigned but you believe you can expedite the process, feel free to comment, requesting to assist or speed up the task. Additionally, you may open a pull request directly because we prioritize both code efficiency and delivery speed. Thus, we encourage multiple individuals to review the same issues and debate together to enhance the code's security.

### Congratulations ! Now you can start work in the issue and everyone knows you are assigned.

## Opening Issue

Before opening an issue, please check if there is no issue open. If there is, feel free to comment or suggest more details. We are always open to feedback and receptive to suggestions!

- Before [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-project), check if your fork is updated.

## Writing Commit Messages

We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Some examples below:

- feat: adds or remove a new feature
- fix: fixes a bug
- refactor: rewrite/restructure your code
- chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- style: changes do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: add missing tests or correcting existing tests
- docs: affect documentation only

## Submiting Pull Requests

You can resolve an issue and after that submit a pull request fixing an issue and remember to [reference that issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword). When submit a PR, put the code below with the number of the issue you are closing
`Example: closes #1`

## Code Review

The maintainers will review your PR. If something is missing or a fix needs to be made, the maintainers will let you know in the PR comment.
