# âœ¦ Manifesto

Swaplace emerged from a simple yet profound vision: to redefine on-chain asset swapping. Inspired by the accessibility and limitless potential of Steam, our open-source platform serves as a dynamic hub of developers and innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.

With a focus on decentralization, Swaplace embodies a community-driven ethos, shaped and fueled by its users' commitment to progress. Operating as an open-source entity, it embodies transparency and trust, empowering users to engage in a secure environment free from centralized points (no allowances stored). Through a culture of innovation and collaboration, Swaplace fosters an ecosystem where developers are recognized for their contributions, and users are afforded the freedom to explore an array of asset swapping possibilities.

Guided by mentorship, support, online events and a pursuit of excellence, Swaplace leads the charge toward a decentralized swap dApp that is both inclusive and resilient, where each interaction propels us toward a product with ample swap opportunities.
