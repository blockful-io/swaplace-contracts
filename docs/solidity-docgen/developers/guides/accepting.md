# âœ§ Accepting

### AcceptSwap

```solidity
function acceptSwap(uint256 swapId, address receiver) external payable returns (bool)
```

Accepts a Swap. Once the Swap is accepted, the expiry is set to zero to avoid reutilization.

Requirements:

* `allowed` must be the zero address or match the caller's address.
* `expiry` must be bigger than the timestamp.
* `biding` assets must be allowed to transfer.
* `asking` assets must be allowed to transfer.

Emits a {SwapAccepted} event.
