# ✧ Incentives

In addition to being an Open Source community, we want to **reward developers** who are contributing to shape the future of web3.

But pay attention to the rules:

* One **contribution** is equivalent to one **merged pull-request.**
* Labels marking “**Good first issue**” are not eligible for rewards due to their simplicity.
* You must be in our Discord server and let us know that you have made the pull-requests.
* Rewards will be in _stablecoins_; make sure to inform us of your preferred wallet to receive the rewards (the value will be sent at the end of the round).
